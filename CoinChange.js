//Given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.
//Return the maximum number of ways that you can make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0

//Runtime complexity
//Quadratic, O(m√ón), where m is the number of denominations and n is the total amount.

//Memory complexity
//O(n), where n is the total amount.
